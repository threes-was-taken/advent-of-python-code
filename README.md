# Advent of Python Code 🐍🎄

This project contains my attempts for the Advent of Code coding challenge. It will serve to strengthen my skills in Python and, along the way, learn more about project structure, naming conventions,....

## Goal

Solve all puzzles from 2015 until the current year, in Python.
